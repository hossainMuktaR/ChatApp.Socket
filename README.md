# ChatApp.Socket

ChatApp.Socket is a real-time chat application built using Kotlin and Ktor. This project demonstrates how to create a socket server and client to facilitate real-time communication between users on Android devices.

## Features

- **Real-time messaging**: Send and receive messages instantly using WebSockets.
- **Multi-client support**: Connect multiple clients to the server seamlessly.
- **User-friendly interface**: An easy-to-use interface for sending and receiving messages.
- **Connection management**: Efficiently handles connections and disconnections.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: A modern programming language for Android development.
- **Ktor**: A framework for building server and client applications in Kotlin.
- **Android**: The mobile operating system for client applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio
- Kotlin 1.5 or later
- Ktor library

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hossainMuktaR/ChatApp.Socket.git
   ```

2. **Open the project in Android Studio**.

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure that the necessary dependencies for Ktor are included in your `build.gradle` files.

### Running the Server

1. Navigate to the server directory (if applicable):
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew run
   ```

### Running the Client

1. Open the Android client application in Android Studio.

2. Ensure that the server is running, and configure the client to connect to the correct server URL.

3. Run the client application on an Android emulator or device.

## Usage

- **Connect to the server**: Upon starting the client, it will attempt to connect to the server using WebSockets.
- **Send messages**: Enter your message in the input field and press Enter to send.
- **Receive messages**: Messages from other connected clients will be displayed in real time.
